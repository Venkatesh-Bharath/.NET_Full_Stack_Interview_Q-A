## General ASP.NET Core Questions (.NET 6+)

1. **What is ASP.NET Core, and how does it differ from ASP.NET?**
   - ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based applications. Unlike ASP.NET, which was primarily designed for Windows, ASP.NET Core supports cross-platform development on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is built to be more modular, flexible, and lightweight.

2. **Explain the middleware pipeline in ASP.NET Core.**
   - The middleware pipeline in ASP.NET Core is a sequence of middleware components that handle HTTP requests and responses. Each middleware can perform tasks like logging, authentication, or response modification. Middleware components are added to the pipeline in the `Program.cs` file using the `Use` methods of the `IApplicationBuilder`.

    ```csharp
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
    var app = builder.Build();

    app.Use(async (context, next) =>
    {
        // Custom logic before the next middleware
        await next();
        // Custom logic after the next middleware
    });

    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });

    app.Run();
    ```

3. **What are some advantages of using ASP.NET Core?**
   - **Cross-Platform:** Can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
   - **Performance:** Offers improved performance and scalability over ASP.NET.
   - **Modular Design:** Allows inclusion of only required components.
   - **Unified Framework:** Combines MVC and Web API into a single framework.
   - **Dependency Injection:** Built-in support for dependency injection.
   - **Open Source:** Community-driven with active support.

4. **Describe the startup class and its role in an ASP.NET Core application.**
   - In .NET 6+, the `Startup` class is replaced by the `Program.cs` file, which combines the roles of configuration and middleware setup. The `Program.cs` file sets up services and middleware in a simplified and more streamlined way.

    ```csharp
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

    // Configure services
    builder.Services.AddControllers();

    var app = builder.Build();

    // Configure middleware
    if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
        app.UseHsts();
    }

    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.MapControllers();

    app.Run();
    ```

5. **How do you configure services in ASP.NET Core?**
   - In .NET 6+, services are configured in the `Program.cs` file using the `CreateBuilder` method. You register services with the `IServiceCollection` through the `builder.Services` property.

    ```csharp
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

    // Register services
    builder.Services.AddControllers();
    builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();

    var app = builder.Build();
    ```

6. **What are dependency injection and its benefits in ASP.NET Core?**
   - Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to manage dependencies in an application. In ASP.NET Core, DI is built into the framework, allowing for better separation of concerns, easier testing, and more maintainable code. Dependencies are injected into constructors, methods, or properties.

    ```csharp
    public class MyController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly IMyService _myService;

        public MyController(IMyService myService)
        {
            _myService = myService;
        }

        // Action methods using _myService
    }
    ```

7. **Explain the concept of routing in ASP.NET Core.**
   - Routing in ASP.NET Core is the process of mapping incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller actions. It is configured in the `Program.cs` file using the `UseRouting` and `MapControllers` methods.

    ```csharp
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

    var app = builder.Build();

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });

    app.Run();
    ```

8. **How do you define a custom middleware in ASP.NET Core?**
   - Custom middleware is defined as a delegate that takes `HttpContext` and `RequestDelegate` as parameters. It is added to the pipeline using the `Use` method.

    ```csharp
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
    var app = builder.Build();

    app.Use(async (context, next) =>
    {
        // Custom logic
        await next();
    });

    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });

    app.Run();
    ```

9. **What are tag helpers in ASP.NET Core?**
   - Tag Helpers are server-side components in ASP.NET Core that enable you to create HTML elements and attributes in a more readable and maintainable way. They are used in Razor views to simplify HTML generation.

    ```html
    <form asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Submit">
        <input asp-for="Name" />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
    ```

10. **What is the purpose of the IApplicationBuilder interface?**
    - The `IApplicationBuilder` interface is used to configure the middleware pipeline in ASP.NET Core. It provides methods to add middleware components to the request processing pipeline.

    ```csharp
    var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
    var app = builder.Build();

    app.Use(async (context, next) =>
    {
        // Custom middleware logic
        await next();
    });

    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
    });

    app.Run();
    ```
